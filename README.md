Delhivery Business Case (Key obejective - Data cleaning, feature engineering for modeling and Inferetial Statistical Analysis)

Role: 

In this project, my goal was to support Delhivery, a leading logistics player in India, in enhancing their operations through data analysis. Delhivery's mission is to create a top-tier operating system for commerce, combining world-class infrastructure, logistics operations, and technology capabilities. The data team needed help with:

- Data Cleaning and Manipulation: Cleaning, sanitizing, and manipulating raw data to extract valuable features.
Data Analysis and Modeling Support: Interpreting the data to aid the data science team in building accurate forecasting models.

Business Insights:

- Hypothesis Testing Results: I conducted hypothesis testing between OSRM data and actual delivery data, revealing significant differences in the means of the two datasets. This discrepancy highlights a gap between expected and actual delivery performance.

- Correlation Between Distance and Time: I found a high correlation between distance and delivery time, confirming that longer distances lead to increased delivery times. This underscores the need to focus on distance in optimizing delivery efficiency.

Regional Analysis:

- Maharashtra: I identified Maharashtra as having the highest number of orders, indicating a substantial customer base in the state.
- North-Eastern States: The North-Eastern states had the lowest number of trips, suggesting a potential area for business growth.
- Warehouse Activity: The busiest warehouses were in Gurgaon_Bilaspur, Bhiwandi, and Bangalore, which are crucial to operations.
- Busiest Route: I observed that the most frequented route was from Bangalore_Nalamngla_H (Karnataka) to Bengaluru_KGAirport_HB (Karnataka), with an average distance of 28.03 km and an average travel time of 87.87 minutes.

Recommendations:

  - Optimize Delivery Times: Since actual delivery times exceed OSRM predictions, I recommend optimizing delivery processes using OSRM routing data to enhance efficiency and reduce delivery times.
  
  - Expand Services in Bangalore: Given the high activity on the busiest route in Bangalore, I suggest increasing service points and manpower in this area to effectively handle the high demand.
  
  - Increase Outlets in Maharashtra: To better serve the large customer base in Maharashtra, expanding the number of outlets in this state could improve service coverage.
  
  - Improve Conditions in North-Eastern States: Address the lower business activity in North-Eastern states by improving operational conditions and implementing targeted marketing strategies to boost service availability and customer engagement.
  
  - Enhance Infrastructure at Busy Warehouses: For the busiest warehouses like Gurgaon_Bilaspur, focus on increasing warehouse capacity or enhancing manpower to manage high operation volumes efficiently.
  
  - Leverage OSRM for Optimal Routing: Utilize OSRM data to ensure minimal distances and optimize routing for cost-effective and timely deliveries.
